# Agile Requirements Tool — Frontend

This is a minimal Vite + React starter for the Agile Requirements Tool.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn)

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\mattg\Documents\SER 515\SER515-project-team5\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on http://localhost:3000 and proxies `/api` to the backend at http://localhost:8080 (configured in `vite.config.js`).

Next steps
- Replace placeholder components with your UI and wire up API calls with `axios`.
- Consider adding React Router, state management, and auth flows as needed.
